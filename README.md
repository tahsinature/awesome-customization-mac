### Setting Up Development Environment

#### Setting up terminals

* [Command Line Tools](https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x) - The Command Line Tool package gives Mac terminal users many commonly used tools, utilities, and compilers, including make, GCC, clang, perl, svn, git, size, strip, strings, libtool, cpp, what, and many other useful commands that are usually found in default linux installations.
* [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew) - The missing package manager for macOS.
* [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2) - The best terminal emulator for MacOS.
* [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - This is the alternative terminal I prefer. Because:<br /> ▸ This is a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. Pretty much available for everything (even android Termux). <br />▸ When I work heavy stuffs like: 7/8 containers running in docker, or running unit, integration, end2end tests, if I do those stuffs on `alacritty`, I get better result.
* [Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) - I love Zsh because of it's tons of plugins.
* [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) - It's an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - It is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Not only for filtering files and folders but for pretty much everything you get as an output in your terminal. To know more about my fzf setup please read [this](#comeback) article.
* [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - This is simply an alternative to `find`. But, with insane performance improvement. And it also has features like respecting `.gitignore` content automatically rather than manually excluding them.
* [ccat](https://github.com/jingweno/ccat) - It is just `cat` but, colorized version of cat displays content with syntax highlighting. I create to replace my original `cat` with `ccat` in  my alias in `.rc` file. See my alias files [here](#comeback)



### Productivity Tools

### Media

#### Video Players

* [Movist Pro](https://movistprime.com) - My first choice
* [IINA](https://github.com/iina/iina) - It's an open source project. My 2nd choice. But I use both
